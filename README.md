# Christoffel-s-menu
A React Native application called Christoffel's Menu enables cooks to design and oversee a menu for their eatery.  The chef can add new menu items to the app, such as the name of the dish, its description, its cost, and the type of course (desserts, main courses, or appetizers).  The home screen lists every item that has been added along with the total number of menu items.

# Features

 predetermined Course Types: When adding menu items, a predetermined list of courses (starters, main dishes, and desserts) can be chosen from.

 Menu Display: The home screen shows every menu item that has been added.

 Total Menu Count: Shows how many menu items have been added so far.
